# DropSentinel Installation Guide

## üõ°Ô∏è Windows SmartScreen Warning - This is Normal!

When you download and run DropSentinel for the first time, Windows may show this warning:

```
Windows protected your PC
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting.
Running this app might put your PC at risk.

App: DropSentinel-Setup-0.1.0-x64.exe
Publisher: Unknown publisher
```

**This is completely normal and expected!** Here's why and how to proceed safely:

## ü§î Why Does This Happen?

1. **No Code Signing Certificate**: DropSentinel is currently not code-signed with an expensive certificate ($300-400/year)
2. **New Software**: Windows is cautious about new applications without established reputation
3. **Security Feature**: SmartScreen protects users from potentially harmful downloads

## ‚úÖ How to Install Safely

### Step 1: Click "More info"
When you see the SmartScreen warning, click the **"More info"** link at the bottom.

### Step 2: Click "Run anyway"
After clicking "More info", you'll see a **"Run anyway"** button. Click it to proceed.

### Step 3: Proceed with installation
The installer will now run normally. Follow the installation wizard.

```

### Option 2: Use Package Managers (Coming Soon)

## üöÄ What Happens After Installation?

1. **System Tray Icon**: DropSentinel runs in your system tray
2. **Background Monitoring**: Automatically monitors your Downloads folder
3. **File Scanning**: New files are scanned with VirusTotal
4. **Threat Detection**: Malicious files are quarantined or deleted
5. **Notifications**: You're alerted about scan results

## ‚öôÔ∏è First-Time Setup

1. **API Key**: You'll need a free VirusTotal API key
2. **Folder Selection**: Choose which folders to monitor
3. **Preferences**: Configure scan settings and notifications

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "This app can't run on your PC"
- **Cause**: Wrong architecture (x64 vs ARM)
- **Solution**: Download the correct version for your system

### "Windows cannot access the specified device"
- **Cause**: Antivirus blocking the installer
- **Solution**: Temporarily disable antivirus or add exception

### Installation fails silently
- **Cause**: Insufficient permissions
- **Solution**: Right-click installer and "Run as administrator"
