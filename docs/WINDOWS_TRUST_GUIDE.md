# Windows Trust & Code Signing Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue: Windows SmartScreen Protection

When users try to install DropSentinel, they see:
```
Windows protected your PC
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting.
Running this app might put your PC at risk.

App: DropSentinel-Setup-0.1.0-x64.exe
Publisher: Unknown publisher
```

## 🔍 Why This Happens

1. **No Code Signing Certificate** - The executable isn't digitally signed
2. **Unknown Publisher** - Windows doesn't recognize the publisher
3. **Low Reputation** - New/unknown files trigger SmartScreen warnings
4. **UAC Shows "Unidentified"** - No verified publisher information

## 🛡️ Solutions (Ordered by Effectiveness)

### Option 1: Code Signing Certificate (RECOMMENDED)
**Cost:** $200-400/year | **Effectiveness:** 100% | **Professional:** ✅

#### Extended Validation (EV) Code Signing Certificate
- **Immediate Trust**: No SmartScreen warnings from day 1
- **Hardware Token**: Highest security level
- **Cost**: $300-400/year
- **Providers**: DigiCert, Sectigo, GlobalSign

#### Standard Code Signing Certificate  
- **Builds Reputation**: Trust improves over time with downloads
- **Software Token**: Easier to manage
- **Cost**: $200-300/year
- **Providers**: DigiCert, Sectigo, Comodo

### Option 2: Self-Signed Certificate (DEVELOPMENT)
**Cost:** Free | **Effectiveness:** 50% | **Professional:** ⚠️

- Reduces some warnings but still shows "Unknown publisher"
- Good for internal testing and development
- Users still need to "Run anyway"

### Option 3: Application Reputation Building
**Cost:** Free | **Effectiveness:** 30% | **Time:** 6+ months

- Submit to Microsoft for reputation analysis
- Distribute through trusted channels
- Build download volume over time

### Option 4: Alternative Distribution
**Cost:** Free | **Effectiveness:** 80% | **Professional:** ✅

- Microsoft Store (requires certification)
- Windows Package Manager (winget)
- Chocolatey package manager

## 🔧 Implementation Guide

### For Code Signing Certificate:

1. **Purchase Certificate** from trusted CA
2. **Update package.json**:
```json
"win": {
  "certificateFile": "path/to/certificate.p12",
  "certificatePassword": "your-password",
  "publisherName": "Your Company Name",
  "verifyUpdateCodeSignature": true
}
```

3. **Environment Variables** (for CI/CD):
```bash
CSC_LINK=path/to/certificate.p12
CSC_KEY_PASSWORD=your-password
```

### For Self-Signed Certificate (Development):

1. **Create Certificate**:
```powershell
New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type CodeSigningCert -Subject "CN=DropSentinel" -KeyUsage DigitalSignature -FriendlyName "DropSentinel Code Signing" -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -TextExtension @("2.5.29.37={text}1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3", "2.5.29.19={text}")
```

2. **Export Certificate**:
```powershell
$cert = Get-ChildItem -Path "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -CodeSigningCert
Export-PfxCertificate -Cert $cert -FilePath "DropSentinel.pfx" -Password (ConvertTo-SecureString -String "password" -Force -AsPlainText)
```
